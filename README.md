# 8fold Image for PHP

A class-based wrapper for PHP's [image processing](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) capabilities.

## Installation

```
composer require 8fold/php-gd-image
```

## Usage

This library is a work in progress based on one production product. If capabilities are not needed by that project (or similar projects), they may not become directly supported by me or other 8fold Practitioners (user contributions are encouraged).

- [delfimox/GDImage](https://github.com/delfimov/GDImage/blob/master/src/GDImage.php)

## Details

We started creating a web shop that interfaced with a print-on-demand provider. We wanted to have a way to host the images on our servers instead of from the provider.
